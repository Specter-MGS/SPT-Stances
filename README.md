# SPT-Stances

Standalone weapon stance mod for SPT-AKI. Inspired by Realism but modular and lightweight.

## 🔧 Features
- Cycle between stances: **High Ready**, **Low Ready**, **Compressed**, **Default**
- Each stance adjusts sway, ergo, and weapon pose in first-person
- Clean client-side BepInEx mod — no server-side dependencies

## 🕹️ Controls
- Press `Y` to cycle through stances

## 🔌 Installation
1. Drop the compiled `SPT-Stances.dll` into:
   ```
   BepInEx/plugins/SPT-Stances/
   ```
2. Launch SPT and hop into a raid
3. Press `Y` to toggle stances — changes are visual and statistical!

## 🧪 Roadmap
- HUD indicator for stance
- Smooth transitions
- Additional stances like "Tilted" or "Off-Shoulder"
- Configurable keybinds and stance multipliers
